A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

This is the first version of the simulation. This version
does not use inheritance.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.

I added the bear animal and moved all the required methods to the animal class.
I made it so that the bear population remained small in comparison to the other two.
This animal acts in a very similar way to the fox.
